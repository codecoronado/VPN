All you need to do is pay a one time $19.99 Lifetime Membership fee. This will cover your membership and token ipo launch fee. It might should like a steep price for membership, but just remember you will have 100,000 ATM Tokens in your wallet. Just imagine once we launch, and our token may reach anywhere between $1 and $5 that will be roughly over $100,000.00 which is noting compared to your $19.99 Lifetime Membership fee. Your membership will also include information on how to refer other members so that you earn even more income.",
