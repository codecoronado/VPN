            "Once you have joined our ATM-Income System, we will send you 100,000 ATM Tokens into your Phantom Wallet. ATM-Income tokens will support Solana blockchain after initial launch of our token. All you need to do is pay a one time small fee of $19.99 for your Lifetime Membership. This will cover your lifetime membership and will help us cover the smart contract audit and token IPO launch application fee. I know, I know... It might sound like a really steep price to pay, but just remember you will have 100,000 ATM Tokens in your wallet at launch. Just imagine the price of the token once we launch, our token will have the capacity to reach anywhere between $1 and $5 with that being said, you could possibly have over $100,000.00 in pure profits! DO NOT let this opportunity pass you by.",
